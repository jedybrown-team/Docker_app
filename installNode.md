To install Node.js and npm on your WSL (Ubuntu) setup, you can follow these steps:

Update the package list (to ensure you’re getting the latest versions):

`sudo apt update`

Install Node.js using the NodeSource repository, which provides the latest version of Node.js.

First, install the required dependencies:

`sudo apt install -y curl`

Now, add the NodeSource repository for the version you want (e.g., Node.js 18):

`curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -`

Then install Node.js:

`sudo apt install -y nodejs`

Verify the installation by checking the versions of Node.js and npm:

```
node -v
npm -v
```

sudo:

sudo stands for "superuser do" and allows you to run commands with elevated (administrator) privileges. Many system-level tasks, like installing software, require administrator rights to make changes to the system.
apt:

apt is the package manager in Debian-based Linux distributions (like Ubuntu). It’s used to manage packages—installing, updating, upgrading, and removing software packages on your system.
-y flag:

The -y flag is used with apt to automatically answer "yes" to any prompts that appear during the installation process. This makes the command non-interactive, so it doesn’t ask for confirmation to proceed.
So, when you run sudo apt install -y nodejs, it:

Elevates privileges to the administrator level (sudo).
Uses the apt package manager to install nodejs.
Automatically confirms the installation prompts with "yes" (-y).
This command is useful for scripting or when you want to skip manual confirmation.

This should install both Node.js and npm, as npm comes bundled with Node.js by default. Let me know if you run into any issues!

The curl command is used here to download and run a setup script directly from NodeSource's website. Here’s why it's needed and what each part does:

Purpose of curl: curl is a command-line tool for transferring data from or to a server. In this case, it’s fetching a setup script from the NodeSource repository.

Setup Script: The script at https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x is a NodeSource installer script that:

Adds the correct NodeSource repository to your package manager.
Sets up the necessary sources so that apt (Ubuntu’s package manager) can install the latest version of Node.js directly from NodeSource.
Command Breakdown:

```
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x fetches the setup script from NodeSource.
-f: Fail silently on server errors.
-s: Silent mode, suppressing extra output.
-S: Shows error messages if there’s a failure (helps in debugging).
-L: Follows any HTTP redirects if the URL points to another location.
Running with sudo -E bash -:
```

This runs the script with root privileges (sudo) so it can add repositories and configure your system.
The -E flag preserves your user environment, which can help in ensuring any environment variables are available when running the script.
In short, curl is just a convenient way to download and execute the setup script in one line, ensuring you have the latest Node.js version on Ubuntu.

---

The command sudo -E bash - combines a few specific elements. Let’s break it down:

`sudo`:

Runs the command with elevated privileges (administrator access).

`-E flag`:

The -E option preserves the user's environment variables when using sudo. This can be important because some scripts may rely on certain environment variables (like PATH, HOME, or custom variables) to function correctly.

`bash`:

This specifies that we’re using the bash shell to execute the script. bash is the most common shell for running commands and scripts in Linux.

- (hyphen at the end):

This tells bash to read from standard input (stdin). In other words, it allows us to pass in commands to bash directly rather than running a script file.

Example in Action
When you run:

`curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -`

curl fetches the script from NodeSource.
The pipe (|) sends the downloaded script directly to bash, which runs it with sudo -E (with elevated privileges while preserving your environment variables).
The - tells bash to accept the script from standard input.
This approach is common when installing software from a remote source because it allows you to run a script with the necessary permissions and environment setup without saving it to a file first.
